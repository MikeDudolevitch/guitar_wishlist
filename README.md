Welcome to the Guitar Wishlist app!\

The function of this web application is to offer a sort of notepad to catalog guitars that a user wants to consider for future purchase.

In order to use this site, you, the user must create an account with a valid email and password, and then sign in. You will be taken to an empty page and be prompted to start creating and saving guitars to save to your profile. There is a form with guitar attributes for you to fill out- the Make and Model fields are required, but there are optional ones for year built and a color description, if you elect to be more specific. Lastly, there is a field to supply an image url from the web of the guitar. Once saved, the details of the guitar, plus the image if provided, with appear in your profile. Simply click a picture of a guitar to view it. Additionally, each guitar has a button to edit the details provided, or to remove it from your profile altogether. 

When done using the Guitar Wishlist app, simply click logout on the bottom of the page. Haooy guitar hunting!
